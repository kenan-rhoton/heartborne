## Studies

### 1. e4

Controls the center, frees the king's bishop (faster castling), frees the queen, does not block any bishop diagonals.

Black's response is base on:

1.  Establishing a pawn on e5 (1. e4 e5)
2.  Establishing a pawn on d5 (1. e4 c6) or (1. e4 e6)
3.  Destroying white's e pawn immediately (1. e4 d5) or (1. e4 Nf6)
4.  Allowing e4 but preventing d4 (1. e4 e5) or *(1. e4 c5)*
5.  Allow white an e4 d4 center and destroy it later (1. e4 g6) or (1. e4 d6)

#### Sicilian defense

The main line is:

1.  e4      c5      (Black stops d4, prepares to open the c file)
2.  Nf3     d6      (White defends d4, and Black can't really attack it further, so it develops d6 to stop e5, free the queen's bishop and protect his c pawn)
3.  d4      cxd4    (White forms a classical center and Black is pretty much forced to take it, opening his c file in the process)
4.  Nxd4    Nf6     (White recaptures with the Knight, getting an open d file and slight space advantage, Black develops his Knight attacking the e4 pawn)
5.  Nc3     a6      (White develops his knight defending his e4 pawn while not opening himself to e5 d5, Black plays a6 to take control of the Queenside)

Najdorf, English attack

6.  Be3     e5      (White has ideas of Qd2, castling Queenside and a Kingside attack, Black forces the strong Knight back, although opening a weakness on d5)
7.  Nb3     Be6     (White retreats the Knight to b3, defending the Queenside and preparinga long term a5 c6 idea, Black must defend the d5 square with his bishop)
8.  f3      Nbd7    (White prepares his Kingside attack protecting e4 and the future g4, Black develops his Knight giving further support to e5 and possibly eyeing c5)
9.  Qd2     Be7     (White continues his Queenside castling plan, and Black prepares to castle Kingside)

Najdorf, positional
6.  Be2     e6      (White quietly develops the bishop, preparing a Kingside Castle)
7.  O-O     Be7
8.  f4      O-O
9.  Be3     Qc7

Najdorf, agressive
6.  Bg5

#### Ruy Lopez

1.  e4      e5      (Black stops d4 and keeps a good center)
2.  Nf3     Nc6     (White attacks the e5 pawn, developing and gaining center control, also planning to castle early, White defends, developing and gaining some center control)
3.  Bb5             (White attacks the Knight, and completes the removal of all pieces that stop him from castling)

Morphy defence, Main line

3.          a6      (Black forces White to make a decision with the bishop)
4.  Ba4     Nf6     (White retreats the bishop "to a better square" - Anish Giri, Black fevelops his Knight, attacking the e4 pawn)
5.  O-O     Be7     (White castles, also indirectly protecting his e-pawn because of Re1, Black develops his bishop, allowing himself to castle)
6.  Re1     b5      (White protects the e-file and is starting to get ready to attack, Black expands his Queenside with a tempo, but does weaken his c pawn)
7.  Bb3     O-O     (White retreats his bishop again, but not to a better square, and Black castles finally)

Morphy defence, exchange variation

Berlin defence
3.          Nf6     (Black ignores the attack and develops a Knight threatening e4)
4.  O-O     Nxe4    (White castles and Black takes the "free" pawn, which IMO is a bad idea)
5.  d4      Nd6     (White fights for the center like a boss, Black cannot take without retreating the Knight first as it would blunder everything)
6.  Bxc6    dxc6    (White exchanges the Bishop for the Knight, removing the e5 defender, and black must take with d pawn, not b pawn, to free his bishop in a way that makes sense)
7.  dxe5    Nf5     (White takes the pawn and Black plays his Knight to a more central position)
