# Play

Each turn a player can use an action:

-   Moving a character to an adjacent lane or retreating
-   Putting a Retreated Character in ANY lane

Then he may use skills.

Then Advantage is gained:

-   By numbers: If you have more characters in one lane than your opponent, you may take advantage from yor opponent in this lane equal to difference (no more than one advantage on a character in this fashion)
-   By skills, as described

# Characters

+Carry: Whenever he gains Advantage, he gains double (the extra one is from the extra pile). If he has 5 or more Advantage, you may Force an opposing character to Retreat at the beginning of your turn. He cannot gain more than 5 Adv.
Support: If no ally in the location has Advantage, gains Advantage. 1 Advantage: put all his remaining advantage on ally in the location.
+Mage: When he moves, he is considered two Characters until end of turn for Advantage by numbers. 2 Advantage: Force a Retreat.
