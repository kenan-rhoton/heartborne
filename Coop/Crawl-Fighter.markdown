### Fight

1.  Enemies in turns move 1 space closer to you. You may move them to any square as long as the distance decreases with you.
2.  When an enemy enters a square you have Strength on, you throw a die for each Strength allocated.
    If you score enough hits, the enemy is slain.
    Any die that are misses move one Strength into your Fatigue area.
3.  Any enemy that becomes adjacent to you and survives will trigger its "Doom" effect and die.
4.  If you survive the onslaught, all Strength points that you allocated this wave are lost.

### Rest

You recover 3 Strength and 1 HP.
