CHANGELIST:

Removed 3 Nuuks - Makes them more meaningful
Added target to draw - Gives more of a feeling of being able to influence
Removed "Crazy!"


PROBLEMS:
Feels too much like UNO
"not playing isn't fun" Skip and Reverse make it easy to "not play"


#New Paradigm: Hunt for Nuuk

Cards are randomly spread about and players need to find a "Nuuk!" play that is not contested by another player's "Wala wala". The first player to do so wins the game.

## Nuuk! and Wala wala

Nuuk! is a victory condition and Wala wala is a contesting condition. Players cannot hold more than X cards in hand.

Example, with normal playing cards: Nuuk being a 5 card straight and Wala wala being someone having both ends of it. X is 5.
