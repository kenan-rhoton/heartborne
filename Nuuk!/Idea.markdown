Reverse Direction
Skip
Crazy! - Change? Remove!
Draw 2 - Target


CHANGELIST:

Removed 3 Nuuks - Makes them more meaningful
Added target to draw - Gives more of a feeling of being able to influence
Removed "Crazy!"


PROBLEMS:
Feels too much like UNO
"not playing isn't fun" Skip and Reverse make it easy to "not play"
