#New Paradigm: Hunt for Nuuk

Cards are randomly spread about and players need to find a "Nuuk!" play that is not contested by another player's "Wala wala". The first player to do so wins the game.

## Nuuk! and Wala wala

Nuuk! is a victory condition and Wala wala is a contesting condition. Players cannot hold more than X cards in hand.

Example, with normal playing cards: Nuuk being a 5 card straight and Wala wala being someone having both ends of it. X is 5.

## Rules
Nuuk is playing 5 "same" stones.
It can be nullified by Wala Wala (playing two other "same" stones at the ends of an opposing Nuuk). The middle stone is turned face down to signify Wala Wala (The player that plays the Wala Wala is responsible for this)
Djuk is playing two stones that are "same" to each of a received Wala Wala stones at the outside of them. The middle stone is turned face up and the Wala Wala stones face down to signify this.
Nuuk Nuuk is achieved by putting two other "same" stones next to an own Nuuk.

At the end of the game, points are added up.

Nuuk: 1pt
Wala Wala: 0pt
Djuk: 1pt
Nuuk Nuuk: 2pt
