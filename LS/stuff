STORYBOARDS

Alfred's Hand: Strategy - Penetration, Unit - Special Commando, 

Beatrice's Hand: Strategy - Split Formation, Advantage - Chokepoint, Tactic - Hold the Line, Tactic - Push Forward

Alfred chooses to Lead From the Front, with an Penetration Strategy, to push for the Main Objective.
Beatrice chooses to Direct from Safety, with a Split Formation, creating three fronts for The Main (Hold), Secondary (Push) An

If Beatrice's Main front is Unable to Hold, she will lose the Battle, but if they Hold, the benefits from the Secondary Objectives will greatly help her to defeat Alfred for the Main Objective.

Currently, Alfred would overrun Beatrice's defense, so she plays the Advantage Card "Chokepoint" which eliminates numbers advantage for a turn, making her Unit able to withstand the attack.

However, Alfred has a Special Commando Unit, which can eliminate one enemy Advantage Card. Alfred wins the Battle. Beatrice, however, wins both Secondary Objectives.


The Second Battle lasts much longer.
