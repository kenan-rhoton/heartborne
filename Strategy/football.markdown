When a player moves a piece that is carrying the ball, the ball moves with it.
When a piece that is carrying the ball is moved by an opponent, the ball stays where it is.
A player who controls the ball may opt to move tha ball from the piece that is carrying it to another on the same rank or file instead of moving, provided there are no opposing Defenders on the way.
