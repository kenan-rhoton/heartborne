##Inquiry

What is the final mystery? Name three clues.
Who did it? Name three clues.
How was it done? Name three clues.
Have the clues? Think of the story that ties it all.
What happens if they don't discover X? It must penalize but imply X being announced.

Allow for other clues when they make sense, especially if the players are being creative.
