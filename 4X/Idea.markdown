##Details

The golden rule: Nothing has any effect unless it's revealed. The instant it is revealed it already has an effect, no matter what else is happening.

The silver rule: When something is revealed, you must reveal you have all requirements for it. If you don't (or can't) it is discarded.

The bronze rule: Each influenced Land may only be used once
