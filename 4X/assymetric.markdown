# Asymmetric strategy

## Idea

It's a 2 player strategy game where each chooses a faction to fight the other, and all factions have extremely different gameplay.

## The Kingdom, worker placement

## The Magus, card management

## The Horde, 


# Symmetric version

## Tokens

-   Scouting tokens (Explore)
-   Development tokens (Expand and Exploit)
-   War tokens (Exterminate)

### Scouting tokens

-   Placing a scouting token on a token or area allows you to view that token or area at any time.
-   Scouting tokens cannot be removed except by the following rule.
-   Whenever a token becomes PUBLIC all scouting tokens on it are removed.
-   Whenever a token or area is scouted by ALL players it becomes PUBLIC.

-   They are all equal
-   They may be placed in any token on a scouted area or in any area.

### Development tokens

-   Placing a development token on a scouted area allows you to benefit from it when it is PUBLIC and JUSTIFIED.
-   A token is PUBLIC when it is face up and all players can clearly see it.
-   A token is JUSTIFIED when ALL of its requirements to function are both PUBLIC and JUSTIFIED.

#### List

-   Exploit Water x 3
-   Exploit Wood x 5
-   Exploit Iron x 3
-   Exploit Stone x 5
-   Exploit Food x 5

-   Workshop(Expansion) [Wood, Water] - You may exploit twice on your turn (but must both exploits are public)
-   Farm(Expansion) [2x Food, 2x Wood] - You no longer need to exploit food


### War tokens

-   Placing a war token on a scouted opposing token allows you to benefit from it when it is PUBLIC and JUSTIFIED.

## The "viable" strategies

-   Herbivore (Appeased): Settle quickly and focus on expansion, speeding your civilization's influence, developing breadth-first and having a very strong foundation. Out-influence everyone.
-   Piscivore (Merchants): Settle quickly and focus on exploiting and building a massive city, developing depth-first. Out-prosper everyone.
-   Carnivore (Titans): Focus on exploiting and expanding just enough to maximize your extermination capabilities. Kill everyone.
-   Omnivore (Nomads): Explore a lot and improvise with what you find, obtaining some very weird but very strong exploits.

## Actions
