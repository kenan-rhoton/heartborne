## Rules

### The Golden Rule

Standard Golden Rule.

### Game flow

At the start of the Game, the Human Player takes all 6 Action Dice and rolls them. Those will be the first Round's Actions.

Players (starting with the Human Player) take Turns by taking an Action Die and either performing its Action or Moving one of their Dice to a connected location.

When at the start of a Player's turn there are no Actions left, the Round ends and any effects that take place at the end of the Round (such as an Alien killing the Human) are resolved. If order matters, the Human Player chooses the order. After this, the Player rerolls ALL the Action Dice and continues his turn as normal.

### The Fight

At the end of each Round, if a Human and Alien share a Location, the Human dies, unless some other rule prevents it.

However, if a Human shares a location with multiple (2 or more) aliens at the end of the Round, the Human dies and NOTHING can prevent this rule.

### Alien Dice

These Dice represent the Alien's state.

OK: No special rules.

Bleeding: a bleeding Alien cannot take any action other than Regenerate (Alien)

Ambush: an alien in the Ambush state will instantly kill the Human if it enters its location. If and alien in the Ambush state moves, it becomes OK.

### Human Dice

OK: No special rules.

Ready: at the end of the Round, if you share a location with an Alien, you don't die, and the Alien becomes bleeding (or dies if already bleeding). You then become OK.

Hiding: You can't be attacked by an Alien. You can't Interact. At the end of the round you become OK.

### Interact

The Human Player (and only the Human Player) may choose to use an Action Dice to Interact instead of performing the Action or Moving.

### The Machine Gun (Weapons Bay)

Interacting with it to use it reduces its ammo (represented by its die) by one. Upon reaching zero it is destroyed. When used, allows you to move an adjacent alien.

### Stimpack (Medical Bay)

While carrying the Stimpack, if you cause an Alien to bleed by being ready, you instead kill the Alien and discard the Stimpack.

### Vents (Halls)

Vents join two distant locations. They may only be traversed by the Human and only when using the Sneak or Interact (Human) actions.

### Lockdown (Security Room)

The Security Room can be interacted with by the Human to Lockdown a room with an Alien, putting a Lockdown die on the number 3 at its location. That location cannot be entered or exited (except through the Vent) untill the number reaches 0. The Lockdown Die decreases by 1 at the end of the round and each time that Alien uses the Tremors (Alien) Action.

### Ship's Controls (Deck)

The Deck has the Ship's Controls, which can be interacted with to cause all Aliens on board to be unable to act for the rest of the Round (all remaining Action Dice go to the Human Player)

### Radio (Communications Bay)

If the Human Player interacts with the Communications Bay, he uses the Radio, losing the ability to use Action Dice until the end of the Round. If the Round ends and the Human Player is still alive, the Human Player wins.

### Blockade

The Human Player may not willingly enter a location occupied by two or more Aliens (he may still be forced to do so by the Alien Player).

### The Actions

Action Dice have an icon on each face that symbolizes what it does. However, Actions are different for the Alien and Human Players.

Any Action Dice may always be used as a "Move a Die to a connected location" Action.

-	 Chase: Run - Move twice (Human); Hunt - Move all 3 Aliens (Alien)

-	 Gun & Claw: Prepare - become Ready (Human); Ambush - enter Ambush state (Alien)

-	 Alien: Execute - kill a bleeding Alien (Human); Regenerate - become OK (Alien)

-	 Size Matters: Sneak - Move 1 and become Hiding. You may move through a Vent in this movement. (Human); Tremors - Discard up to two unused Action dice. (Alien)

-	 Flash: Lucky Break - Immediately end the Round (Human); Teleport - Move an Alien to another Alien's Location (Alien)

-	 Sound Wave: Listen - Give the Alien player a free turn, then use all remaining Action Dice in the Roun (Human); Scream - Move a Human sharing a Location or Adjacent with an Alien. You must move him further from your Alien. (Alien)
