##Setup

Board has 3 "Fronts":

-   Pick first or Initiative
-   Victory point
-   2 Extra Character

Shuffle the character deck

Reveal 8 characters.

Both players discards one, then each take turns picking one. The last player to pick gets the Initiative.

Each player secretly assigns his characters facedown to a front (any to each). Use the Screen to cover this assignment.

##Play

A player may reveal one of his characters at any time.

Each turn all characters advance in their front. Unrevealed characters are considered power 5 and advance once.

When characters would clash, compare their power. The character with the lowest power is then removed from the round. Add power to each equal to how much they've surpassed the center before clashing.
