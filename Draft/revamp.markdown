# Revamp

## Objectives

-   Having to plan ahead... a lot

## Methods

-   Draft phase at the beginning where players choose their champions
-   Play must have MANY available moves that the player must choose from on his turn, and he may only make ONE.

### Attempts

#### v1
-   Units may MOVE to ANY location as long as they don't need to cross through an enemy to achieve it.
-   Units may ENGAGE an enemy at their location if they haven't moved this turn.
-   A Unit ENGAGED by two or more enemy units DIES and is removed from the game.
-   Units may RETREAT from an engaged enemy if they haven't moved and they can move to an adjacent location where there are no enemies.
-   Draft at LEAST 5 Units each.
-   Symmetrical objective, plox.

## Storylines

### Siege

REVEAL
1. The champions in play for the game are revealed: Ranger, Hero, Berserker, Kingsguard, Knight, Ogre, Wizard, Assassin

PICK PHASE
2. Alfred BANS Assassin, thinking that the game is going to play out into many solo fights and giving Assassin to the Attacker is too much
3. Bruce PICKS Kingsguard, mainly because letting Alfred take him when there is no easy way to take him down (since Assassin is banned) would be too much, and he pairs well with both Wizard and Ranger.
4. Alfred PICKS Ranger, thinking that it's very good with Kingsguard and can help him lock out one of the towers while he focuses on securing the bridge later on.
5. Bruce PICKS Wizard, both for Kingsguard synergy and to discourage any Berserker or Ogre picks from Alfred, which now wouldn't be able to completely block off areas.
6. Alfred PICKS Knight, seeing that he can now take advantage of having two very mobile Champions versus two relatively immobile ones, and really being able to parry most threats.
7. Bruce PICKS Berserker because he now realizes his mobility problem and although he might've been happier picking the Ogre, there was almost no way he would've been able to catch Alfred's Knight and Ranger with that team, and he would have a very hard time on his attack.
8. Alfred PICKS the Hero in the end, deciding that what he is lacking really is a solid unit that he can rely on to at least hold if things get out of hand.

DEPLOY PHASE
9. Alfred PLACES the Hero on the Throne Room, as that seems the most logical, and he wants to wait to see what Bruce's deployment looks like before committing his Knight or Ranger.
10. Bruce PLACES the Kingsguard on the Invasion, since he can hold and he wants to be able to place his other two reactively.
11. Alfred PLACES the Ranger on the Tower and the Knight at the Bridge, since that seems to be the most flexible setup.
12. Bruce PLACES the Wizard at Forest and the Berserker at River, avoiding the awful plan of having a Berserker vs the Ranger.

PLAY PHASE
13. Alfred chooses to SUPPRESS the Wizard with the Ranger, avoiding any starting shenanigans possible.
14. Bruce answers with an ENGAGE from the Kingsguard on the Knight, threatening to swoop in with his Berserker and finish him off.
15. Alfred chooses to ENGAGE with his Hero onto the Kingsguard, dissolving that threat, yet momentarily committing all his Champions.
16. Bruce seizes the opportunity to ENGAGE the Ranger with his Berserker.
17. Alfred RETREATS his Ranger into the Throne Room.
18. Bruce TELEPORTS the Wizard onto the Bridge, threatening Wizard BLASTS Knight.
19. Alfred SUPPRESSES Wizard and Kingsguard on the Bridge with his RANGER, threatening everything.
20. Bruce ENGAGES Ranger with his Berserker, stopping the SUPPRESSION.
21. Alfred ENGAGES the Wizard with his Knight, forcing .
22. Bruce ENGAGES the Ranger with his Kingsguard
