# Attacker drafts and places first

## Units

King: Brings three Kingsguard (highest unit count)
Infantry: Three units with Formation. Conquer:Kill if together. (High threat until separated or killed, second highest unit count)
Knight & Squire: Two units with Riverside Formation. Knight has Conquer:Kill. Squire has Protect. (High threat on the Riverside until separated)
Assassin: Automatically kills a lone opposing unit in the same area. Climbing. (High area denial due to threat, great Peak control)
Archer: Can sacrifice your move to kill an opposing unit on an adjacent, lower area. (Great defense at Towers and Mountain Pass)
Titan: Expels up to two enemy units upon entering an area. (Great area control especially vs Infantry and Knight & Squire)
Wizard: Can freeze and unfreeze the River at will. (Should be great at centre control. He isn't)

## Draft 1, no Titan

A picks Assassin (I believe this is the best offensive unit right now)
D picks King (Ditto for defense)
A picks Infantry (High threat and number, what's not to like?)
D picks Archer (Great defense and seems to thwart Infantry)
A picks Knight (Mini infantry that resists Archer)
D picks Wizard (I should really buff Wizard)

A places Infantry on Barracks. (It's the versatile pick)
D places King on Throne Room. (You always want the King in the Throne Room)
A places Assassin on Forest and Knight on Encampment. (Assassin likes Peak, Knight likes River)
D places Wizard on Mountainside Tower and Archer on Riverside Tower (Wizard can easily move over to defend, Archer can hold off everything easily there).

A: Ass -> Peak (That's why you pick Assassin)
D: KG -> Mt T (And that's why you pick King)
A: Inf -> For (If A wants to win, he probably should focus on Mountainside)
D: Arch -> Thr (Moving over the Archer to Mountainside too, Knight doesn't seem to really threaten anything)
A: Kn+Sq -> Meadows (Turn down for what?)

SCRATCH

# Defender also bans first, one gets left out, 1 minute per decision

## Unit update

King: Kingsguard have Protect. If the King dies they all die.
Knight: Also has Bash 1.
Archer: Also has Climbing.
Titan: Bash 2.
Wizard: Teleport 2.
Hero: Unconquerable.
Berserker: Conquer: Kill all. Dies when outnumbered.
Lancer: Charge. (Move two and gain Conquer: Kill if no enemies on the first move)

## Draft 1: Hero, Titan, Berserker, Wizard, Infantry, Assassin, Lancer, K&S

D bans Assassin
A picks Lancer
D picks Infantry
A picks Titan
D pick Wizard
A picks K&S
D picks Berserker

A places K&S on River Encampment, Lancer & Titan on Forest
D places Infantry on River Tower, and Wizard and Berserker on Throne Room

1 A: Titan -> Meadows (preparing a Riverside breakthrough through the Infantry)
1 D: pass (can't improve defense I think)
2 A: K&S -> Bridge (starting the break)
2 D: Inf -> Bridge ?? (Forced because after Titan -> Bridge the same break will happen but with a better position for A), Conquer! Kills Squire.
3 A: Titan -> Bridge !!, Bash 2 Infantry, Conquer! Kill 1 infantry and it's game over...

2 D: pass
3 A: Titan -> Bridge
3 D: Inf -> Bridge !?
4 A: Lance -> Mountain Pass -> Mountain Tower
4 D: Wiz TP(Bersk) -> Bridge !!, Conquer! Kill all, A resigns

4 A: Lance -> Meadows -> Bridge !!, Conquer! Kill x 2, and D resigns

Lasts 16mins at most

## Draft 2: Wizard, Archer, Assassin, Knight & Squire, King, Titan, Lancer, Berserker

D bans K&S
A picks Wizard
D picks Titan
A picks Assassin
D picks Berserker
A picks King
D picks Lancer

I'm pretty sure A just completely destroyed D in picks

A places everything on Forest.
D places Titan and Berserker on Mountain Tower, Lancer on Throne Room.

A: Ass -> Peak (Freezing all enemy units pretty much and winning the game, yo)

Note: pick something good vs Assassin or he can just instantly win any game.

Lasts 10 mins.

## Draft 3: King, K&S, Arch, Ass, Inf, Hero, Bersk, Titan

D bans Ass
A picks Inf
D picks Arch
A picks K&S
D picks King
A picks Titan
D picks Hero

A places Infantry and Titan on Forest and K&S on River Encampment.
D places Archer on Mountainside Tower, King and Hero on Throne Room

1 A: Inf -> Mountain Pass
1 D: Arch -> Peak
2 A: Inf -> Mountain Tower
2 D: Hero -> Mountain Tower
3 A: K&S -> Bridge
3 D: Arch Kill Titan
4 A: K&S -> Riverside Tower
4 D: Arch kill Inf unit or resign (can he shoot?)

Notes:
-   Where can the Archer shoot exactly? Seems kinda arbitrary. Maybe adjacent but NOT castle or peak? Also climbing archer is super OP unless there is an Assassin to cancel it.
-   Squire SHOULD stop Archer. He doesn't. Modify Protect? And if protect is up in power, maybe remove it from the Kingsguard and let it be a Squire only thing.
-   Hero SUCKS, dude. Maybe move Unconquerable unto Titan (and make him the official Infantry-wrecker) and redo the guy.

# Same rules, units redone

# Units

King: Kingsguard no longer have Protect.
K&S: Protect reworked to "Nullify first Kill in a turn vs this unit".
Archer: Can shoot at any adjacent location except for Throne Room, Towers and Peak. No longer has climbing.
Titan: Now has Unconquerable. Bash reworked to be stackable (Bash 2 means "Bash 2 units 1 location or Bash 1 unit 2 locations")
Hero: Reworked to "Immortal. Conquer: Bash & Kill"

## Draft 1: Wiz, As, K&S, Titan, Inf, King, Hero, Arch

D bans As
A picks Inf
D picks Titan
A picks K&S
D picks Archer
A picks Wizard
D picks King
