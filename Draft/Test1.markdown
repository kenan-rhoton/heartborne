# Flow

1.  Sides are randomly decided
2.  Characters are shuffled
3.  6 Random characters are drawn
4.  Players take turns to pick one
5.  Players take turns to assign each one to one of their starting zones.
6.  Players take turns moving one of their characters to another valid zone until either:
    a)  Conquer win: Attacker has more characters in Castle Hall than opponent at the end of his turn.
    b)  Fortify win: It is no longer possible for the Attacker to win (Defender must demonstrate this).
    c)  Siege win: All players have all remaining units on the Defender's side and the Defender makes a null move.
    d)  Time win: The same position has been repeated three times. Defender wins.

# Test 1 under these rules

A vs D

Knight(Encampent), Infantry(Barracks), Assassin(Forest) vs King(Castle), Titan(River), Archer(Mountain) -> Attacker wins too easily. Riverside Archer may avoid this, so since I skipped the placement draft I will now test with that phase.

# Test 1 under these rules

Drawn: Knight, Infantry, Assassin, King, Titan, Archer.
Attacker picks first.
