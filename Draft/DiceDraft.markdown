# Dice Draft

## Setup

-   Take out the "board" or "map"
-   Roll all the dice! :D
-   Donezo

## Rules

-   Take turns placing dice onto the board
-   Whoever has more dice on his side of the board at the end of the game wins!

## Mechanics

-   Uneven dice number
-   Any dice modifications must maintain parity

## Dice faces

-   Bully (1): This die can displace any existing die.
-   Mage (2): Swap two adjacent dice.
-   Warrior (3): Remove exactly two adjacent dice from the board.
-   Thief (4): Dice diagonally adjacent to the Thief score no points. Instead, the Thief scores their points.
-   King (5): Dice may not be placed orthogonally adjacent to the King. The King may not be placed orthogonally adjacent to any die. *Unfun*
-   Queen (6): If the Queen is surrounded, she scores 3 points.

## Starting numbers

Dice: 15
Board: 4x4

Heavily favors P1?
