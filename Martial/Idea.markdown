Gain anger tokens.

##Assault Winner

The first person to finish the chain (or the Blocker if someone blocked) starts executing the Flow Chain in order.

His opponent then executes his Flow Chain in order.

After everything has been resolved, players count their points, and whoever has more wins the Assault. Then any Mindset or Execution benefits are taken into account.

##Start

Players draft for three mindsets each.

Each mindset provides 2 starting Flows and 1 Execution.

The winner of an Assault can always add a Flow with a buy cost inferior to his Assault Points.

    -   Execution: Kick
-   Speed (Blue): Having a longer chain nets you an extra card
    -   Flows: Combo, Fast
    -   Execution: Punch
-   Reduce (Green): Countering at least 2 Flows nets you an extra card
    -   Flows: Close x2
    -   Execution: Lock
